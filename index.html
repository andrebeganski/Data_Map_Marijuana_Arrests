		While recreational marijuana is on track to become a multi-billion dollar industry in New York, the state has had a history of punitive drug laws and practices like stop-and-frisk that have unfairly impacted Black and Brown communities.<br><br>

		“The scent of cannabis has historically been used for police interactions with people of color,” said Tahir Johnson, director of social equity and inclusion at the <a href="https://www.mpp.org/">Marijuana Policy Project</a> (MPP), an organization in the U.S. dedicated to legalizing cannabis.<br><br>

		In 2019, as New York toyed with the idea of legalization, former Governor Cuomo signed a <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/s6579">law</a> that decriminalized the possession of marijuana in small amounts.
		</p>

		<img src="images/Marijuana_Arrests_Over_Time.gif" alt="There were 291 arrests and summonses issued for marijuana possesion in Q3 of 2019. This fell to 26 in 2021." class="main_photo"> 

		<p>
		As a result, arrests and summonses for possession plummeted quickly. Between 2019 and 2021, there was a 90 percent decrease in the number of those issued, where only 26 summonses and arrests for marijuana possession took place this year between July and the end of September throughout the city.<br><br>

		“The data captures the impact that cannabis legalization can have on social justice and civil rights,” said Johnson, pointing out the high number of arrests and summonses in the Bronx from 2019 compared to other boroughs.<br><br>

		“It shows the need for legalization as an issue of fairness in our society, regardless of marijuana as a substance.”
